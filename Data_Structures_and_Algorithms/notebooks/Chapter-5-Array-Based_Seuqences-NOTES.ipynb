    "### 5.1 Python's Sequence Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we explore Python's built-in sequence classes like __list__, __tuple__, and __str__. Each of them support indexing to access individual elements of a sequence, using syntax seq[k], and each uses low-level concept known as an __array__ to represent sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Low-Level Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Any individual byte of memory can be stored and retrieved in $O(1)$ time. In general, a programming language keeps track of the association between an identifier and the memory address in which associated value is stored. A group of related variables can be stored in a contiguous portion of the computer's memory. We will denote such a representation as an __array__. Each location - __cell__, location within array - __index__.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2.1 Referential Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Python represents a list or tuple instance using internal storage mechanism of an array of object __references__. A single list instance may include multiple references to the same object as elements of the list, and it is possible for a single object to be an element of two or more lists, as those lists simply store references back to the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "__[Side Note](https://medium.com/@meghamohan/mutable-and-immutable-side-of-python-c2145cf72747):__ Objects of built-in types like (int, float, bool, str, tuple, unicode) are immutable. Objects of built-in types like (list, set, dict) are mutable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2.2 Compact Arrays in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The strings are represented using an array of characters (not an array of references). We refer to this type representation as  a __compact array__. The overall memory usage for a compact structure is much lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor for the array class requires a __type code__ as a first parameter ([More Info](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html)) \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When creating a low level array in computer system, the precise size of that array must be explicitly declared in order for the system to properly allocate a consecutive piece of memory for its storage (Pythons _tuple_ and _str_). List, on contrary, uses __dynamic array__, which allows the addition of element, with no apparent limit on the overall capacity of the list. Every time the capacity reached, the class requests more memory.\n",
